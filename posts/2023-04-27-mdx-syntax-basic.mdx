> A small major this time, nothing big, which is also nice sometimes! This mainly drops support for old Node (use 16 or later), adds modern ES2024 support in MDX, supports `await` in MDX (if your framework does too), and removes several deprecated options.

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com) allows you to use `JSX` in your markdown content. You can **import components**, such as _interactive charts_ or _alerts_, and embed them within your content. This makes writing long-form content with components a blast. ðŸš€

Here's a simple footnote,[^1] and here's a longer one.[^bignote]

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <>
      <p>{count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>+1</button>
    </>
  )
